# Resizer
### A simple image resizer

## Description
This is just a simple image resizing application. The user would use the file input to upload a picture, which they'll see immediately as they do so.
The "Resize" button should appear at the bottom and, when pressed, should send the image to the back-end which will send back a resized photo to the
front-end. Images are only resized to 500x500 for now and any photo that is smaller than that will not be resized (for obvious reasons).
